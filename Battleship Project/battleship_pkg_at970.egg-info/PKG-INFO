ï»¿# Welcome to Battleship!

Here all main features that are given within the specifications should be functioning. This is a simple implementation of battleship on python, it can be run with or without a GUI.


# Prerequisites

This project requires the use of python version 3.9, installation of python's virtual environment package, and flask. For the flask to work it requires the use of a virtual environment.

## Installation

To download these modules you can run:
pip install Flask
pip install virtualenv

## How to run

Using virtual studio code, run the file main.py. In the terminal a url should appear. You can copy and paste this root url, then add 
"/placement" to the end of the url. This is the ship placement page. Now you can add your ships, then press send game. This will direct you to where you can play the game.
