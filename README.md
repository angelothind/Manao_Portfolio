The battleship project has a readme file which instructucts user on how to initiate the game. 
The machine leaerning coursework is related to datasets included inside the folder. 
The jar file includes a piece of coursework I did, it is used to mimic a system which records information about bike racing like the tour de france. I do not have the interface as the assignment was to create the backend of the system, thus there is no frontend to operate.
